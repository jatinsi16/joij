<h1> LETTER TO HIM </h1>
<p> know that I don’t tell you that I love you enough 
    so I thought I would write you this romantic love letter
    to show you how much I adore you. When I look outside on a rainy day 
    and see the clouds, I find peace in knowing that you are my sunshine. 
    You light up my life and I bask in seeing your face first thing in the morning. I know 
    that love isn’t easy sometimes, it takes a lot of commitment, trust and honesty
    to make it work. We started off as two naive kids in love and now we’ve matured 
    together and our love has blossomed into something so beautiful that I
    treasure it every single day.</p>

<h2> Here Is A Poem That I Really Like</h2>
<p> 
  Forgive me <br/>
   if I stumble and fall<br/>
  For I know not how <br/>
   to love too well<br/>
  I am clumsy<br/>
  and my words<br/>
   do not form as I wish<br/>
  so let me kiss you instead<br/>
  and let my lips <br/>
   paint for you <br/>
   all the pictures<br/>
  that my clumsy heart <br/>
  cannot.<br/>
</p>
